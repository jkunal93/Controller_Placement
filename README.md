# Controller Placement
  This project focuses on sovling the controller placement problem in Software Defined Networks. An Improved K-means algorithm is proposed to address the problem that partitions the network into k sub-networks. Results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can divide the network into same sub-networks irrespective of the random initial node.

- "K-means" is the main class of this program
- "Delay" is a separate class used to generate a file of delays of n nodes
- More details can be found in the project report
